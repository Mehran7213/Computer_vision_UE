Redundant code, especially duplicating or copying the given code in different places, will result in a deduction of 25 points.
Importing the same packages multiple times will result in a deduction of 25 points.
All packages are imported in the first code cell. Any changes to this cell, including modifications, removals, or additions of packages or libraries, will result in a deduction of 50 points.
